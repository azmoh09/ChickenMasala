Indian food is so spicy üå∂Ô∏è ü•µ, but our tasks is more.
Collaborating with your teammates, build a full App for Indian foods app using the csv file provided in the resources section.

Steps:
- Have a design for the app on Figma (sketches, wireframes, prototype) are not required.

- Import the CSV file into assets and parse it.
(avoid use singleton object from kotlin in your app).

- Implement the design that your team created and link it to the data from CSV, you can also have some static data, and/or any idea related to Indian food and food in general.


Requirements:
- Single Activity Pattern (your app should only have one Activity and its name should be HomeActivity).

- Use Fragments for each screen instead of activity.

- Your app should have a splash screen (splash screen shouldn‚Äôt be an activity or fragment) and app icon.

- At least you should have 8 Fragments (Screens).

- If you have some scrollable List in your design (Recycler View) don't Implement them this week, leave them for the next week.

- Your App should have some logic, don't make only stupid colorful scrollable items, for example you can create a logic to show meals that you can prepare fast, or meals doesn't have some Ingredients that user select like food doesn't have Mustard.

- As a User I should have the ability to search for any Indian food and get useful information about it.

- As a User I hate to see the same data on the home screen every time I open the app.
so make the app show different data on the home screen every time the user launch the app.

- As a non Indian User I love to know more about indian food history so you can put some static data to help me to know more.

- Try your best to make everything clickable with a navigation to other views.

- Use ViewBinding to access the views, and follow the explained tech-stack.

- Use git and branch in an efficient way, and don't forget to ask for 2 review for each pull request.

- Follow the OOP principles that you learned from the previous weeks.

- Build a BaseFragment abstract class similar to what we did in the tutorial for activities.

- Use Material 3 Design System for this app.

- Have fun while working on this project.
and we wish you the best of luck.
